# Getting Started with Cell-Based Coadds

```{abstract}
As development for cell-based coadds continue, their testing will become pertinent during the commissioning process. This technote is meant to be an initial guide to generating and using cell-based coadds within the context of the LSST Science Pipelines and USDF, where several example use cases will be outlined in the form of brief code snippets and  initial analyses. Example code will also be maintained in the form of Jupyter notebooks, currently found [here](https://github.com/mirarenee/notebooks/tree/main/cell_coadds/technote).
